> **Advanced entropy analysis powered by local Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**.

MX is a free, open-source, **Zero-Dependency** Machine Learning anticheat for Minecraft (1.8 - 1.21). 
Powered by powerful heuristic algorithms combined with machine learning on a self-written RNN (Millennium 5) basis.

## 🧠 The Millennium 5 Engine

MX is built upon the **Millennium 5** self-written open-source library. It is a plug&play fully custom Deep Learning framework written in Java for CPU.

### Key Technologies:
*   **Local Processing:** No external Python scripts, no GPUs, no cloud API calls required. Everything runs asynchronously on your server's CPU.
*   **Architecture:** Stacked Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional) with Attention Mechanism, Layer Normalization, AdamW.
*   **Model:** `quark-e-1.0-56k-public` (56,000 parameters) — capable of detecting many 'clever' hacks.
*   **Advanced Heuristic:** From basic to advanced heuristics, perfectly complemented by machine learning.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation
1. Download the latest release `.jar`.
2. Drop it into your `plugins` folder.
3. Restart the server.
4. **Done.** The pre-trained weights are loaded automatically from JAR.

### Training Your Own AI (Optional)
MX allows you to train the neural network directly on your server to adapt to new cheats.

1.  **Collect Data:**
    *   Record a cheater: `/mx dataset cheat <player>`
    *   Record a legit player: `/mx dataset legit <player>`
    *   *Play for ~30-60 minutes to gather samples.*
2.  **Train:**
    *   Run `/mx train <model_index> <epochs>` (e.g., `/mx train 7 16`).
    *   The plugin will run the **AdamW** optimizer (Backpropagation) in the background.
3.  **Deploy:**
    *   The new weights are saved automatically.

## 📂 Configuration

MX is highly configurable.
*   **`checks.yml`**: Enable/Disable specific checks, tune statistical thresholds.
*   **`config.yml`**:
    *   `prevention`: Set the harshness of lag-backs (0 = Silent, 3 = Aggressive).
    *   `ignoreCinematic`: Reduce false positives for cinematic camera users.
    *   `rotationsContainer`: Enable storing movement history for the `/mx activity` command.

## 🤝 Contributing

MX is open-source under the **Unlicense**. You are free to fork, modify, sell, or do whatever you want with the code.

**We need your help:**
*   Submit datasets of new private cheats.
*   Share trained `.dat` model weights.
*   Improve the math logic.
